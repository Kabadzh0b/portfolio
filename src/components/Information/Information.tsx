            <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Max. Nice to meet you.</h1>
            <p>Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 11 years ago, I've done remote<br/>
                work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create<br/>
                digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally<br/>
                curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.<br/>
                I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.</p>
