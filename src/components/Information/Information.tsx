            <p>Since beginning my journey as a developer over a year ago, I've done a lot of projects<br/>
                for improving my skills, consulted with a strong developers, and collaborated with talented people.<br/>
                I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my skills<br/>
                I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.</p>
